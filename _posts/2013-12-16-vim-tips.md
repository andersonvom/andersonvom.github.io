title: Vim Most Used Commands
---

Lately at work we've been using a combination of
[vim](http://www.vim.org/download.php)/[tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/) to
make pair programming a lot easier.  This is especially helpful when working
remotely or under a crappy internet connection, as you won't need high
bandwidth.

While both vim and tmux allow you to highly customize your shortcuts, changing
them too much will make your pair's life harder, since they'll have to memorize
_your_ specific shortcuts, so keeping the defaults will make everybody's lives
easier.


vim is a big beast on its own, but in a good way.  You can find a huge number of
plugins out there that will make you go crazy, so to keep sanity levels to a
maximum, I use a single one: [Janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus).

Janus bundles together a lot of really useful plugins to make a devs' life
simpler (fuzzy search, ack, git commands, additional syntaxes, and more).  As
such, most (if not all) shortcuts I list here will really only work with it:


    :new                      # open a new file
    :e path/to/file           # edit specific file
    :w                        # save file
    :q                        # quit/close file
    CTRL+p                    # fuzzy search and open file
    :%s/search/replace/g      # search and replace
    :Ack <search>             # find <search> in all files

    :set foldmethod=indent    # fold according to indent
    :set foldlevel=1          # defaults to folding first level

    CTRL+wv                   # split window vertically
    CTRL+ws                   # split window horizontally
    \n                        # open file tree

    H                         # Move cursor to top of the screen
    M                         # Move cursor to middle of the screen
    L                         # Move cursor to bottom of the screen
    CTRL+d                    # Move half a page down
    CTRL+u                    # Move half a page up

    d<move>                   # delete <move>
    y<move>                   # copy <move>
    c<move>                   # chage <move>
    .                         # repeat last command
    zO                        # open all folds under cursor
    zo                        # open first fold level under cursor
    zc                        # close current fold block
    zx                        # close all but current fold block
    <<                        # unindent line/block
    >>                        # indent line/block
    p                         # paste contents after/before current line

    gg                        # move to first line of the file
    G                         # move to last line of the file
    w                         # move one word forward
    b                         # move one word backward
    t<char>                   # move just before <chat>
    f<char>                   # move to find <char> in the current line
    ^                         # move to first character in the line

    v                         # create visual block
    V                         # create visual block with whole lines
    CTRL+v                    # create a vertical block

    \gb                       # git blame current file
    \gs                       # git status


These are all the commands I can remember using _all the time_.  I believe this
short list will make it possible for the newcomers out there to try and give vim
a change and get passed the --incredibly-- steep learning curve (compared to other,
more visual, editors out there).

Let me know if you have any commands that you use all the time as well!
