title: About Me
---

I'm [Anderson Mesquita][linkedin] (@andersonvom) and I'm a software
developer from Brazil.  I hold a BS degree in Computer Science from the
Federal University of Ceará and I've been doing all sorts of professional
development for about 7 years now: Ruby, Python, C, Javascript, PHP,
Java, and Perl are the programming languages I've used in my jobs.

I currently work as a software engineer for [ThoughtWorks][] and
contribute to [Openstack][] as a TW consultant at [Rackspace][].  In the
past I have worked for the [Inter-American Development Bank][iadb], the
[Network and Telecommunications Group][great], the [Federal University
of Ceará][ufc].

In my spare time you can find me hacking away, practicing Aikido,
photographing, riding my bike around, ballroom dancing, enjoying good
beer with my friends, playing guitar, or doing something completely
random.

If you want to **contact me**, just prove that you're not a robot (I
tend not to trust them a whole lot) and find out what my email address
is by following this tip: [YW5kZXJzb252b20gKiBnbWFpbAo=][base64].
