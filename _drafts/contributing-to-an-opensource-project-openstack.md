title: Contributing to an Open Source Project: OpenStack
---

I've been working on [OpenStack][] for a little over three months now
and it has been a great experience: not only I'm being paid to write
code that is used by millions of people, this code is also freely
available for people to read and improve as they see fit.  Having used
opensource software for a long time now, working in an opensource
project had been in my checklist of things to do as a developer and it's
been a great pleasure to be able to give it back to the community as my
full-time job and fulfill my desire.
